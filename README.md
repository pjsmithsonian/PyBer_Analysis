# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to summarizes how the data differs by city type and how these differences can guide decisions at PyBer.

## Results
Below are the results which were found in this analysis by city type.

### Rural
Our rural city markets offer us the highest average fare, $34.62, and the highest average fare per drive, $55.49. While this may seem more lucrative to us and the drivers, this is likely due to the spread out nature of rural cities. Each trip will be a further distance than suburban or urban city trips. This leads to a higher average fare, but with a lower density popultion, we are not making as much in total fares, $4,327.93, as many rides as we would anticipate in the other markets, with both suburban and urban having total fares in excess of $19,000 each. Overall, the fares were not super consistent and had a max of $500 at the beginning of April.

### Suburban
In our suburban markets we are seeing solid numbers in both the average fare per ride, $30.97, and average fare per driver, $39.50. These are encouraging because at these numbers, it will further incentivize drivers to work in this market. At a nice midpoint of being less spread out than a rural market and more spread out than the urban market, it helps to keep these drivers happy. Suburban fares fluxuated, but are on an upward trajectory leading into May.

### Urban
The majority of our drivers are located in the urban market. With a dense population this does make sense. There is a problem that there are more total drivers than our total rides, so this is a more competitive market for our drivers. The average fare per ride, $24.53, is also our lowest in that category meaning that our drivers while competing for rides, are making less when they win out. With so many rides that happen in the urban market, however, it is by far our highest total fare, $39,854.38, market. Urban total fares were on the rise from January through February, but March saw these fares start to decrease. While it may not be for certain, but this could be due to riders during winter in the city wanting to stay out of the more inclement winter weather. With warmer weather bring alternative transportation, including, but not limited to walking and public transit.

## Summary 
Based on the results above, I would recommend three items going forward.
 1. We should continue to invest more into the suburban market. The number of drivers is still below the number of of rides and with such a high average share per ride, it could provide the necessary incentive to get these additional drivers. With this market seemingly on the rise, our investment will increase our total fares by a good amount.
 2. The urban market seems over-saturated with drivers, so we should not invest in obtaining more drivers. While there will continue to be a high number of rides, maintaining our current drivers, or allowing some to leave voluntarily, would work to increasing the average fare per driver and we would have no issue meeting demand.
 3. Our attention to the rural market should remain steady. We are doing well to meet the demand in this market and with such a high fare per ride, we are doing well to contribute to the total fares for the amount of drivers that we have.
